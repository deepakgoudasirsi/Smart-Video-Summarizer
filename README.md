# Smart Video Summarizer - Project Explanation

## üìä Project Overview

The **Smart Video Summarizer** is an AI-powered tool specifically designed for healthcare professionals to quickly analyze and understand video content, such as surgery recordings and patient consultations, without having to watch the entire video.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### 1. Intelligent Video Processing

* Extracts key frames from videos
* Detects scene changes
* Analyzes visual content using computer vision (OpenCV)

### 2. Advanced Speech Recognition

* Converts spoken content to text using Google Cloud Speech-to-Text
* Supports multiple languages
* Provides word-level timestamps for precise analysis

### 3. AI-Powered Summarization

* Uses the BART model from Hugging Face Transformers
* Generates concise summaries of video content
* Extracts key points and important events

### 4. Sentiment Analysis

* Analyzes emotional tone of the content
* Provides sentiment scores over time
* Identifies key emotional moments

### 5. Visualization & Analytics

* Creates timeline visualizations
* Generates frame analysis graphs
* Provides comprehensive summary visualizations

### 6. Multi-Format Output

* Text summaries
* Audio summaries
* Video summaries with key moments

## üìà Technical Architecture

### Core Components

* `video_processor.py`: Handles video processing and frame extraction
* `transcription.py`: Manages speech-to-text conversion
* `summarizer.py`: Generates concise summaries using NLP
* `audio_generator.py`: Converts text summaries into speech
* `sentiment_analyzer.py`: Performs sentiment analysis on transcript
